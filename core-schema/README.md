# Core Schema

This directory contains the core portion of the Asset-Procedure schema. The core schema is organized into multiple subdirectories, each focusing on a specific aspect of the schema, such as extensions, assets, and procedures. Each subdirectory contains SQL documents that define the relevant tables and structures necessary for the core functionality of the Asset-Procedure system.

It is recommended to review the README files in each subdirectory for detailed information about their contents and purpose, and changes to the core schema should be made with careful consideration of their impact on the overall system.
