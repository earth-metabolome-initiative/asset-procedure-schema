# SQL Procedure Constraints

Specialized constraints for validating tables in the `procedures` and `procedure_templates` DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs). This crate builds on top of [`sql-rules`](https://github.com/earth-metabolome-initiative/sql-rules) to enforce domain-specific naming and structural rules for procedure-related database schemas.
